I'm getting a huge response from this and won't be able to immediately reply to everyone. I am pinging some people who are helping. There are two major issues at this point. Getting the data from my local system to wherever and figuring out bandwidth (since this is a very large dataset). Please keep checking for new updates. I am working to make this data publicly available ASAP. If you're a larger organization or university and have the ability to help seed this initially (will probably require 100 TB of bandwidth to get it rolling), please let me know. If you can agree to do this, I'll give your organization priority over the data first.
